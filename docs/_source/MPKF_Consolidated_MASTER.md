# MPKF Consolidated MASTER

## Overview

This is the consolidated master document that serves as the authoritative source for all MPKF (Master Project Knowledge File) framework components, requirements, and specifications.

## Framework Components

### 1. Pre-TDD Client Questionnaire v2.0
The Pre-TDD Client Questionnaire v2.0 is the foundational component that defines the data collection requirements for Technical Design Document generation. It ensures that all necessary information is gathered before document generation begins.

### 2. Universal Enterprise-Grade TDD Template v5.0
The Universal Enterprise-Grade TDD Template v5.0 provides the standardized structure for all Technical Design Documents. It includes 9 stages of comprehensive documentation covering all aspects of technical project planning.

### 3. Adaptive Complexity Model
The Adaptive Complexity Model defines four complexity levels (Simple, Startup, Enterprise, MCP-Specific) and specifies the required fields for each level, ensuring that documentation is appropriately sized for each project type.

### 4. Self-Audit Requirements
Self-audit requirements ensure that generated documents meet quality and compliance standards through automated validation and reporting.

### 5. Phoenix and Iris Gem Schemas
Phoenix and Iris Gem schemas provide downstream compatibility for enterprise systems, ensuring that generated documents can be integrated with existing enterprise infrastructure.

### 6. MCP Protocol Compliance
MCP (Model Context Protocol) compliance specifications ensure that AI/LLM tools meet the necessary standards for integration with language models and AI systems.
