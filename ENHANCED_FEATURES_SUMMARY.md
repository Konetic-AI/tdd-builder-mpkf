# Enhanced Features Summary

This document summarizes the latest enhancements to the TDD Builder MPKF Tool.

## üéØ Overview

Four major enhancements have been implemented to improve the onboarding experience:

1. **Complete "Why We Ask" Documentation** - Every question now includes contextual help
2. **Rich Examples for Enum Fields** - Realistic examples for all dropdown/multi-select fields
3. **Noninteractive Import/Export** - Save and reuse interview answers
4. **Privacy-Safe Analytics** - Opt-in telemetry to improve the tool

---

## 1. "Why We Ask" Everywhere ‚úì

### What Changed
All schema questions now include a `help.why` field that explains the purpose and importance of each question.

### Implementation
- Scanned `schemas/Pre-TDD_Client_Questionnaire_v2.0.json`
- Added concise one-liner explanations to all questions lacking help.why
- Each explanation focuses on the business or technical value of collecting this information

### Examples

**Before:**
```json
{
  "id": "cloud.provider",
  "question": "Which cloud provider will you use?",
  "options": ["aws", "azure", "gcp", "other"]
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "id": "cloud.provider",
  "question": "Which cloud provider will you use?",
  "options": ["aws", "azure", "gcp", "other"],
  "help": {
    "why": "Cloud provider choice affects service availability, pricing models, regional options, and integration capabilities with your existing tools and infrastructure.",
    "examples": {...},
    "learnMore": "https://docs.mpkf.io/cloud-providers"
  }
}
```

### Questions Enhanced
- `cloud.provider` - Cloud provider selection rationale
- `cloud.regions` - Region selection impacts
- `datacenter.location` - Datacenter location considerations
- `security.controls` - Security control importance
- `privacy.controls` - Privacy control requirements
- `privacy.regulations` - Regulatory compliance implications
- `operations.monitoring` - Monitoring capability benefits
- `operations.sla` - SLA commitment impacts

---

## 2. Examples for Enum Fields ‚úì

### What Changed
Questions with dropdown/multi-select options (`validation.enum`) now include 2-3 realistic examples under `help.examples`.

### Format
Examples are displayed in a key-value format showing the option and its real-world use case:

```json
"help": {
  "examples": {
    "option_value": "Real-world explanation or use case",
    "another_option": "Another concrete example"
  }
}
```

### Enhanced Questions

#### Cloud Provider
```json
"examples": {
  "aws": "Amazon Web Services - largest provider with most services",
  "azure": "Microsoft Azure - best for Microsoft ecosystem integration",
  "gcp": "Google Cloud Platform - strong in AI/ML and data analytics"
}
```

#### Operations SLA
```json
"examples": {
  "99.9": "~8.7 hours downtime/year - suitable for internal tools",
  "99.95": "~4.4 hours downtime/year - standard for business applications",
  "99.99": "~52 minutes downtime/year - required for critical systems",
  "99.999": "~5 minutes downtime/year - mission-critical, requires multi-region"
}
```

#### Privacy Regulations
```json
"examples": {
  "gdpr": "EU data protection law - applies to EU citizens' data worldwide",
  "hipaa": "US healthcare data protection - required for medical records",
  "pci-dss": "Payment card security standard - required for credit card processing"
}
```

### User Experience
When users see these questions in the CLI:
1. Examples are displayed in a formatted table
2. Helps users make informed decisions
3. Reduces confusion about technical terminology
4. Provides real-world context

---

## 3. Noninteractive Import/Export ‚úì

### What Changed
Added two new CLI flags for saving and loading interview answers:
- `--export-answers <file>` - Save answers to JSON file after interview
- `--answers <file>` - Load answers from JSON file (skip interview)

### Use Cases

#### Save Answers for Reuse
```bash
# Complete interview and save answers
node cli.js --export-answers ./my-project-answers.json

# Use a template and save the customized answers
node cli.js --template healthcare --export-answers ./healthcare-custom.json
```

#### Load Saved Answers
```bash
# Generate TDD from saved answers
node cli.js --answers ./my-project-answers.json

# Also works with the legacy --noninteractive flag
node cli.js --noninteractive ./my-project-answers.json
```

#### Combined Workflows
```bash
# Start with template, export answers, and generate PDF
node cli.js --template saas --export-answers ./saas-answers.json --pdf

# Load answers, use different complexity, export PDF
node cli.js --answers ./base-answers.json --complexity enterprise --pdf
```

### File Format
Exported JSON includes:
- All question answers
- Selected complexity level
- Metadata (timestamp, version)

```json
{
  "project.name": "My Project",
  "deployment.model": "cloud",
  "cloud.provider": "aws",
  "complexity": "standard",
  "_metadata": {
    "exported_at": "2025-10-07T12:00:00.000Z",
    "version": "2.0"
  }
}
```

### Benefits
- **Reproducibility** - Generate same TDD multiple times
- **Version Control** - Track answer changes over time
- **Collaboration** - Share baseline answers with team
- **Iteration** - Start from previous answers, modify as needed
- **CI/CD Integration** - Automate TDD generation in pipelines

---

## 4. Privacy-Safe Analytics ‚úì

### What Changed
Implemented an opt-in telemetry system that collects anonymized usage metrics to improve the tool.

### Activation
```bash
# Enable telemetry for this session
export ONBOARDING_TELEMETRY=1
node cli.js

# Or set permanently in your shell profile
echo 'export ONBOARDING_TELEMETRY=1' >> ~/.zshrc
```

### What Gets Tracked

- Core questions duration
- Review stage duration
- Deep dive duration
- Total session time

#### Questions Skipped by Tag
- % of security questions skipped
- % of privacy questions skipped
- % of operations questions skipped
- Overall completion rate

#### Template Usage
- Which templates are most popular
- Template + customization patterns
- Success rates by template

#### Complexity Recommendations
- Recommended vs. selected complexity levels
- How often users override recommendations
- Most common complexity levels

### What Is NOT Tracked
‚úÖ **No PII (Personally Identifiable Information)**
- No project names

1. **Opt-in only** - Disabled by default
2. **Local storage** - Data stays on your machine
3. **Anonymized** - No way to identify users or projects
4. **Transparent** - All code is open source and auditable
5. **User control** - Easy to disable, view, or delete data
