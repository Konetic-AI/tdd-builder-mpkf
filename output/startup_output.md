### 1.2 Executive Summary
- **Problem Statement:** `Small teams waste hours on task management overhead, switching between multiple tools and losing context.`
- **Proposed Solution:** `Build an AI-powered task management app that auto-categorizes, prioritizes, and suggests task assignments based on team patterns.`
- **Key Architectural Decisions:** `Monolith-first architecture for speed, Next.js + Supabase for rapid development, OpenAI API for AI features, focus on web-first (mobile later)`
- **Business Outcomes & Success Criteria:** `50 paying teams in first 3 months, <2s task creation time, 80% weekly active user retention, NPS > 40`

- **Out-of-Scope Functionality:** `Mobile apps, advanced reporting, custom integrations (beyond Slack), white-labeling, enterprise SSO`
- **Key User Personas & Roles:** `Remote team leads (25-40 years old) managing distributed engineering/product teams, tech-savvy early adopters comfortable with AI tools`

### 2.2 Constraints & Assumptions
- **Technical Constraints:** `Must integrate with Slack API, limited AI budget ($500/month), need to support 100 concurrent users initially`
- **Business & Budget Constraints:** `6 months runway, 2-person founding team, target launch in 8 weeks, $5K infrastructure budget`
- **Legal & Compliance Constraints:** `*Not Provided*`
- **Key Assumptions:** `*Not Provided*`
