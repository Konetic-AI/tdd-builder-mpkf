## Micro Builds Guide

This section provides a breakdown of the TDD into atomic micro builds for vibe coding success.  
The goal is to decompose a comprehensive TDD into smaller, testable deliverables — enabling iterative flow-state development and reducing context drift.

### Categories & Examples

| Category        | Examples                               | Micro Build Focus                                   |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Core Modules    | Authentication, Dashboard, Billing     | Standalone features (e.g., login flow with tests).  |
| User Workflows  | Onboarding, Data Import, Report Gen.   | End-to-end journeys (e.g., signup → first action).  |
| Shared Components | Notifications, Search, File Upload   | Reusable UI/logic chunks (e.g., upload handler).    |
| System Services | API Layer, Integrations, Logging       | Backend services (e.g., endpoints with monitoring). |

### Suggested Workflow (10 Steps)

1. **Brainstorm & Scope**: Draft concise PRD/README with features, stack, milestones.  
2. **One-Shot MVP Framework**: Scaffold repo (e.g., Next.js, Supabase) in Replit.  
3. **Break Down into Categories**: Use the table above to split the TDD into micro builds.  
4. **Plan Mode per Feature**: New chat per feature (auth, workflow, service). Outline 3–5 micro steps.  
5. **Implement in Isolation**: 20–30 min coding loops per micro build.  
6. **Test & Review**: Unit/integration tests per micro build. Use AI for code reviews.  
7. **Commit & Integrate**: Version-control each micro build with clear commit messages.  
8. **Iterate with Feedback**: After each feature, run end-to-end tests and refine docs.  
9. **Scale to Full Build**: Repeat until all categories are covered.  
10. **Stage Deployments**: Release core modules first, then workflows, components, and services.  

This approach ensures modular progress, faster feedback loops, and a scalable TDD-to-build workflow.
