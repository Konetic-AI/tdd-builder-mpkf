  "doc.approval_status": "Draft",
  "doc.type": "MCP Tool Specification",
  "project.name": "MCP-Enabled Financial Advisory Tool",
  "summary.problem": "Financial advisors need an AI assistant that can safely query internal knowledge bases and execute trades on behalf of clients.",
  "summary.solution": "Build an MCP tool that provides an LLM with secure, audited access to a 'query knowledge base' tool and a 'execute trade' tool.",
  "summary.key_decisions": "Implement per-request authorization, use JWT tokens for user context, maintain complete audit trail, sandbox all operations",
  "summary.success_criteria": "Zero unauthorized trades, 100% audit trail coverage, < 1s tool response time, SEC compliance certification",
  "context.business_goals": "Reduce average time for advisor research by 50%; ensure 100% auditability of all AI-initiated trades.",
  "context.scope_in": "MCP server implementation, knowledge base query tool, trade execution tool, audit logging, permission system",
  "context.scope_out": "LLM training, front-end chat interface, existing trading system modifications",
  "context.personas": "Financial Advisors, Compliance Officers, Risk Managers, System Administrators",
  "constraints.technical": "Must run within the existing enterprise AI platform and adhere to all SEC regulations for financial software.",
  "constraints.business": "$500K budget, 6-month timeline, must pass SEC audit",
  "constraints.compliance": "SEC Rule 17a-4, MiFID II, SOX compliance, FINRA regulations",
  "constraints.assumptions": "LLM will respect tool boundaries, existing APIs are stable, audit requirements won't change",
  "architecture.style": "Serverless functions (AWS Lambda) exposed via an MCP-compliant server.",
  "architecture.principles": "Zero-trust security, principle of least privilege, defense in depth, complete auditability",
  "architecture.tech_stack": "AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB for audit logs, Node.js, TypeScript, MCP SDK",
  "architecture.c4_l1_description": "The Advisor's LLM communicates with the MCP Tool, which in turn interacts with the internal Knowledge Base API and the Brokerage API.",
  "architecture.c4_l2_description": "The tool is composed of an MCP Server, a 'Query' Lambda function, and a 'Trade' Lambda function, each with its own IAM role.",
  "architecture.data_model": "Tool request/response schemas per MCP spec, audit log entries with full context, permission cache for performance",
  "architecture.data_flow_description": "LLM sends JSON-RPC request → MCP Server validates → Lambda executes with user context → Response sanitized → Audit logged → Result returned",
  "nfr.performance": "Tool execution latency must be < 1 second.",
  "nfr.scalability": "Support 100 concurrent advisors, 1000 requests/minute peak",
  "nfr.availability": "99.99% uptime during market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)",
  "nfr.maintainability": "Comprehensive tool documentation, automated testing, monitoring dashboards",
  "nfr.usability": "Clear error messages for LLM consumption, intuitive permission model for administrators",
    "nfr.cost": "< $10K/month operational costs",
    "nfr.tradeoffs": "Prioritize security over performance, audit completeness over storage efficiency",
    "security.threat_model": "Critical threats include prompt injection leading to unauthorized trades and the LLM hallucinating incorrect financial data.",
    "security.auth": "JWT tokens with user context, API Gateway validation, Lambda authorizers for fine-grained permissions",
    "security.controls": "Input validation, output sanitization, rate limiting, anomaly detection, encryption everywhere",
    "security.data_classification": "Trading instructions (Critical), Market data (Confidential), Audit logs (Restricted)",
    "security.mcp_protocol_compliance": "The tool will fully implement the MCP JSON-RPC 2.0 specification, including robust error handling and request validation to prevent malformed inputs. All requests will be validated against the official MCP schema. Error responses will follow the standard MCP error format with appropriate error codes.",
    "security.mcp_sandboxing_model": "The tool will run in a minimal-privilege container with no file system access and a strict network policy that only allows egress to the specified Knowledge Base and Brokerage APIs. Each Lambda function will have its own execution role with precisely scoped permissions. No persistent storage beyond audit logs.",
    "security.mcp_permission_model": "Dynamic, per-request permissioning will be used. The calling LLM must present a JWT token containing the end-user's ID, which is then used to fetch user-specific permissions (e.g., max trade volume, allowed asset classes) before any action is taken. Permission checks are cached for 5 minutes to balance security and performance. All permission evaluations are logged.",
    "privacy.controls": "Client data anonymization in logs, PII tokenization, data minimization in tool responses",
    "privacy.residency": "All data must remain within US-EAST-1 region",
    "privacy.retention": "Audit logs: 7 years per SEC requirements, Cache: 5 minutes, Temporary data: immediate deletion",
    "ops.deployment_strategy": "GitOps-based deployment using ArgoCD to a dedicated sandboxed Kubernetes namespace.",
    "ops.environments": "Dev (isolated), UAT (production-like), Production (highly restricted)",
    "ops.logging": "CloudWatch for application logs, separate DynamoDB table for immutable audit trail",
    "ops.monitoring": "CloudWatch metrics for latency and errors, custom dashboards for trade volume, alerts for anomalies",
    "ops.disaster_recovery": "RTO: 15 minutes, RPO: 0 (no data loss acceptable for trades), automated failover to secondary region",
    "implementation.methodology": "Agile with 1-week sprints due to criticality, pair programming for all code",
    "implementation.team": "Security Architect, 2 Senior Engineers, Compliance Specialist, QA Security Tester",
    "implementation.roadmap": "Month 1: MCP server scaffold, Month 2: Query tool, Month 3: Trade tool, Month 4: Security hardening, Month 5: Compliance testing, Month 6: Production deployment",
    "implementation.testing_strategy": "Unit tests with 100% coverage, integration tests against mock APIs, penetration testing, compliance validation",
    "risks.technical": "MCP specification changes, prompt injection attacks, API compatibility issues",
    "risks.business": "Regulatory changes, advisor adoption resistance, reputation risk from AI errors",
    "risks.mitigation": "Strict input validation, comprehensive logging, gradual rollout with close monitoring, insurance coverage",
    "debt.known": "MCP SDK is still evolving, may need custom extensions for financial use cases",
