# Inline Help Feature - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

All acceptance criteria have been met and the inline help feature is now live.

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria Status

### ✅ Users can reveal help inline
- **Implementation**: Questions with help display a `(?)` affordance
- **Trigger**: Users type `?` at any question prompt
- **Result**: Help is displayed immediately without leaving the CLI flow

### ✅ Help displays all required information
- **Why**: Clear explanation of question importance
- **Examples**: Formatted as aligned table with key-value pairs
- **Learn More**: Underlined URL links to documentation

### ✅ No change in happy-path friction
- **Optional**: Help is completely opt-in via `?` command
- **Non-intrusive**: `(?)` indicator is subtle and color-coded
- **Fast path**: Users can answer directly without viewing help

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. Schema Updates
**File**: `/schemas/Pre-TDD_Client_Questionnaire_v2.0.json`

Updated 9 questions with enhanced help format:
- `doc.version`
- `project.name`
- `summary.problem`
- `summary.solution`
- `project.description`
- `deployment.model`
- `security.auth`
- `privacy.pii`
- `architecture.scale`

**New Format**:
```json
{
  "help": {
    "why": "Explanation of importance",
    "examples": {
      "option1": "Description of option 1",
      "option2": "Description of option 2"
    },
    "learnMore": "https://docs.mpkf.io/topic"
  }
}
```

### 2. CLI Enhancements
**File**: `/cli.js`

#### Updated Functions:

**`displayQuestion()`**
- Added `showHelpAffordance` parameter
- Shows `(?)` indicator when help is available
- Maintains backward compatibility

**`displayHelp()`**
- Enhanced to support both object and array examples
- Formats object examples as aligned table
- Displays learn more links with underline
- Added visual separators for better readability

**`askQuestion()`**
- Passes `showHelpAffordance` flag to `displayQuestion()`
- Updated help instruction text

### 3. Documentation
Created comprehensive documentation:
- `/docs/INLINE_HELP_FEATURE.md` - Full feature documentation
- `/INLINE_HELP_SUMMARY.md` - Implementation summary (this file)
- Updated `/README.md` with feature description and usage

## 🎨 Visual Examples

### Before Help Request
```
[3/10] Where will this be deployed? (?)
  💡 This determines your infrastructure approach

  1. cloud
  2. on-premise
  3. hybrid
  (Type '?' for help)

  Your answer: _
```

### After Typing '?'
```
━━━ Help ━━━

Why We Ask:
  Deployment model affects architecture decisions, cost structure,
  scalability options, security requirements, and operational complexity.

Examples:
  cloud      → Deploy to AWS/Azure/GCP for scalability and managed services
  on-premise → Run in company datacenter for regulatory compliance
  hybrid     → Critical data on-premise, compute workloads in cloud

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Results
✅ All tests passing
✅ No linter errors
✅ Schema loads correctly with new format
✅ Backward compatibility maintained (array examples still work)
✅ Help displays correctly with object examples
✅ Visual formatting is clean and readable

### Test Coverage
- Object-based examples display as tables ✓
- Array-based examples display as lists ✓
- Learn more links display with underline ✓
- Help affordance `(?)` shows correctly ✓
- Help can be toggled on/off per question ✓

## 🔄 Backward Compatibility

The implementation maintains full backward compatibility:
- Old array-based examples still work
- Questions without help are unaffected
- Existing CLI workflows unchanged
- Non-interactive mode unaffected

## 📦 Files Modified

1. `/schemas/Pre-TDD_Client_Questionnaire_v2.0.json` - Schema with enhanced help
2. `/cli.js` - CLI with inline help rendering
3. `/README.md` - Updated with feature description
4. `/docs/INLINE_HELP_FEATURE.md` - New documentation file
5. `/INLINE_HELP_SUMMARY.md` - This summary file

## 🚀 Usage

### For Users
```bash
# Start interactive mode
node cli.js

# At any question, type '?' to see help
Your answer: ?
```

### For Contributors
When adding new questions:
```json
{
  "id": "my.question",
  "question": "What is your question?",
  "help": {
    "why": "Why this matters...",
    "examples": {
      "option1": "Description",
      "option2": "Description"
    },
    "learnMore": "https://docs.mpkf.io/topic"
  }
}
```

## 📊 Impact Metrics

- **Questions Enhanced**: 9 out of 15 core questions
- **Lines of Code**: ~100 lines added/modified
- **Breaking Changes**: 0 (fully backward compatible)
- **User Friction**: 0 (help is optional)
- **Documentation**: 3 new files created

## 🎉 Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Users understand why questions matter
2. **Higher Quality**: Examples guide better answers
3. **Self-Service**: Links reduce need for support
4. **Consistency**: Unified help interface
5. **Maintainable**: Help lives with questions in schema

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements identified:
