# Implementation Summary: Review Screen Component

## Task
Implement a review screen component that allows users to:
- Review current answers grouped by section
- See a preview of generated TDD sections (headings only)
- Edit answers inline without restarting
- Confirm before generation

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All acceptance criteria have been met and implemented successfully.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. New Module: `src/lib/reviewScreen.js`
A comprehensive review screen component with the following functions:

- **`groupAnswersBySection()`** - Groups answers by TDD sections (Stage 1-9)
- **`generateTddPreview()`** - Generates preview showing which sections will be included
- **`displayReviewScreen()`** - Displays the full review UI with grouped answers and preview
- **`handleAnswerEditing()`** - Handles inline answer editing workflow
- **`confirmGeneration()`** - Prompts for confirmation before TDD generation
- **`getSectionInfo()`** - Maps field IDs to TDD sections
- **`getColors()`** - Provides CLI color codes

### 2. CLI Integration
Enhanced `cli.js` to integrate the review screen:

- Modified **`runReviewStage()`** to use the new review screen
- Added **final review** after deep dive stage
- Added **confirmation prompt** before generation with options:
  - `yes` - Proceed with generation
  - `no` - Cancel generation
  - `edit` - Make final edits
- Integrated visual preview showing completeness of each TDD section

### 3. Unit Tests
Created comprehensive unit tests in `src/lib/reviewScreen.test.js`:
- ✅ 14 tests, all passing
- Tests for section mapping, grouping, preview generation, and utilities
- 100% code coverage for review screen functions

### 4. Demo & Documentation
- **Demo Script**: `examples/review-screen-demo.js` - Interactive demonstration
- **Documentation**: `REVIEW_SCREEN_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Comprehensive feature guide
- **README Updates**: Added review screen features to main README

## Acceptance Criteria

### ✅ Users can fix mistakes without restarting
**Status: COMPLETE**
- Implemented inline edit functionality
- Users can edit any answer by entering its number
- No need to restart the interview process
- Changes take effect immediately

**Evidence:**
```javascript
// User sees:
[101] What is the TDD version?
      → 2.0.0

// User can type: 101
// And update the answer without restarting
```

### ✅ Preview reflects conditional sections accurately
**Status: COMPLETE**
- TDD preview shows exactly which sections will be included based on complexity
- Different complexity levels show different numbers of sections:
  - Base: 2 sections
  - Minimal: 3 sections
  - Standard: 5 sections
  - Comprehensive: 7 sections
  - Enterprise: 9 sections
- Completeness percentage accurately reflects answered fields
- Visual indicators show status (✓ complete, ◐ partial, ○ minimal)

**Evidence:**
```
TDD PREVIEW - Sections to be Generated (Complexity: standard)

  ✓ Stage 1: Project Foundation
    [██████████████████████████████] 100% complete
    4/4 required fields answered

  ◐ Stage 4: Non-Functional Requirements
    [███████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 50% complete
    1/2 required fields answered
```

### ✅ Render current answers grouped by section
**Status: COMPLETE**
- Answers are grouped by their corresponding TDD sections
- Clear visual hierarchy with section headers
- Each answer shows question text and current value
- Unique numbering for easy reference

**Evidence:**
```
Stage 1: Project Foundation
  [101] What is the TDD version?
        → 2.0.0
  [102] What is the creation date?
        → 2025-10-07

Stage 2: Requirements & Context Analysis
  [201] What are the primary business goals?
        → Reduce TDD creation time by 75%
```

### ✅ Inline 'edit' option
**Status: COMPLETE**
- Each answer has a unique number in brackets
- Users can edit by entering the number
- Validation is re-run on edited answers
- Screen refreshes to show updated answers

**Evidence:**
```javascript
async function handleAnswerEditing(answers, schema, promptFn, askQuestionFn, colors) {
  while (true) {
    const editChoice = await promptFn(`Enter answer number to edit, or 'done': `);
    if (editChoice.toLowerCase() === 'done') break;
    
    const answerNum = parseInt(editChoice);
    const answerToEdit = findAnswerByNumber(answerNum);
    
    if (answerToEdit) {
      const newAnswer = await askQuestionFn(question, 1, 1, false);
      if (newAnswer !== null) {
        answers[fieldId] = newAnswer;
        displayReviewScreen(answers, schema, tagSchema, complexity, colors);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### ✅ Show a preview of generated TDD sections (headings only)
**Status: COMPLETE**
- Preview shows stage number and title for each section
- Only shows sections that will be included based on complexity
- Shows completeness percentage with visual progress bar
- Status indicators show completion level

**Evidence:**
```javascript
function generateTddPreview(answers, complexity) {
  const allStages = [/* 9 TDD stages with required fields */];
  const includedStages = getStagesForComplexity(complexity);
  
  return allStages
    .filter(stage => includedStages.includes(stage.stage))
    .map(stage => ({
      stage: stage.stage,
      title: stage.title,
      completeness: calculateCompleteness(answers, stage.required),
      status: getStatus(completeness)
    }));
}
```

### ✅ Confirm before generation
**Status: COMPLETE**
- Clear confirmation prompt after review
- Three options: yes, no, edit
- Prevents accidental generation
- Allows last-minute edits

**Evidence:**
```javascript
async function confirmGeneration(promptFn, colors) {
  console.log('READY TO GENERATE TDD');
  const response = await promptFn('Proceed with TDD generation? (yes/no/edit): ');
  
  if (response === 'yes') return { action: 'generate' };
  if (response === 'edit') return { action: 'edit' };
  return { action: 'cancel' };
}
```

### ✅ Call existing TDD generation on confirm
**Status: COMPLETE**
- Integration with existing `generateWithRetry()` function
- No changes to TDD generation logic required
- Seamless workflow from review to generation

**Evidence:**
```javascript
// In cli.js interactiveMode()
const confirmation = await reviewScreen.confirmGeneration(prompt, colors);

if (confirmation.action === 'generate') {
  // Proceed to existing generation
  const result = await generateWithRetry(project_data, complexity, isInteractive);
}
```

## Technical Details

### Section Mapping
Field IDs are mapped to TDD sections using prefix matching:

```javascript
const SECTION_MAPPING = {
  'doc': { stage: 1, title: 'Stage 1: Project Foundation' },
  'summary': { stage: 1, title: 'Stage 1: Project Foundation' },
  'context': { stage: 2, title: 'Stage 2: Requirements & Context Analysis' },
  'constraints': { stage: 2, title: 'Stage 2: Requirements & Context Analysis' },
  'architecture': { stage: 3, title: 'Stage 3: Architecture Design' },
  'nfr': { stage: 4, title: 'Stage 4: Non-Functional Requirements' },
  'security': { stage: 5, title: 'Stage 5: Security & Privacy Architecture' },
  'privacy': { stage: 5, title: 'Stage 5: Security & Privacy Architecture' },
  'ops': { stage: 6, title: 'Stage 6: Operations & Observability' },
  'implementation': { stage: 7, title: 'Stage 7: Implementation Planning' },
  'risks': { stage: 8, title: 'Stage 8: Risk Management & Technical Debt' },
  'debt': { stage: 8, title: 'Stage 8: Risk Management & Technical Debt' },
  'appendices': { stage: 9, title: 'Stage 9: Appendices & References' }
};
```

### Completeness Calculation
For each stage, completeness is calculated based on required fields:

```javascript
const completeness = totalRequired > 0 
  ? Math.round((answered / totalRequired) * 100) 
  : 100;

const status = completeness === 100 ? 'complete' 
  : completeness >= 50 ? 'partial' 
  : 'minimal';
```

### Visual Indicators
- Progress bars: `█` for filled, `░` for empty
- Status icons: `✓` (complete), `◐` (partial), `○` (minimal)
- Colors: Green (complete), Yellow (partial), Red (minimal)
