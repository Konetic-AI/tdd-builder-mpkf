# TDD Builder CLI Guide - 3-Stage Interview System

## Overview

The TDD Builder CLI now features an enhanced 3-stage interview system that makes gathering project requirements more intuitive and efficient.

## 3-Stage Interview Process

### Stage 1: Core Questions (5-7 essentials)
Essential questions to establish the project foundation. These are the minimum required to get started.

**Questions include:**
- Project name and version
- Problem statement and solution
- Deployment model and cloud provider
- Authentication methods
- PII handling

### Stage 2: Review & Edit
Review all your answers before continuing. You can edit any answer at this stage.

**Features:**
- View all collected answers
- Edit any answer by entering its number
- See auto-recommended complexity level
- Decide whether to continue to deep dive

### Stage 3: Deep Dive (Optional)
Detailed questions organized by topic. You can skip entire sections if they're not relevant.

**Topics include:**
- Security & Compliance
- Operations & Monitoring
- Architecture & Scaling
- Privacy Controls
- And more...

## Command Line Options

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Interactive mode - Full 3-stage interview
node cli.js

# Show help
node cli.js --help
```

### Non-Interactive Mode

Load answers from a JSON file and generate TDD without any prompts:

```bash
# Load from file
node cli.js --noninteractive examples/sample_answers.json

# Legacy flag (still supported)
node cli.js --file examples/sample_answers.json
```

### Filtering Options

#### Filter by Tags

Only ask deep dive questions related to specific topics:

```bash
# Focus on security and privacy
node cli.js --tags security,privacy

# Focus on operations
node cli.js --tags operations
```

**Available Tags:**
- `foundation` - Project basics and setup
- `architecture` - System architecture and design
- `security` - Security controls and compliance
- `operations` - Operational concerns and monitoring
- `privacy` - Data privacy and protection

#### Set Complexity Level

Manually set the complexity level for deep dive questions:

```bash
# Enterprise level (most comprehensive)
node cli.js --complexity enterprise

# Standard level (balanced)
node cli.js --complexity standard

# Auto-recommend based on answers (default)
node cli.js --complexity auto
```

**Complexity Levels:**
- `base` - Basic project (~4 questions)
- `minimal` - Simple project (~10 questions)
- `standard` - Typical project (~20 questions)
- `comprehensive` - Complex project (~35 questions)
- `enterprise` - Enterprise-grade (~48+ questions)

### PDF Export

Generate a PDF version of the TDD:

```bash
# Interactive mode with PDF
node cli.js --pdf

# Non-interactive with PDF
node cli.js --noninteractive examples/sample_answers.json --pdf
```

### Combined Options

You can combine multiple options:

```bash
# Non-interactive, filter by security, set enterprise complexity, export PDF
node cli.js --noninteractive examples/sample_answers.json --tags security,privacy --complexity enterprise --pdf

# Interactive, filter operations, export PDF
node cli.js --tags operations --pdf
```

## Interactive Features

### Help Toggle - "Why We Ask" (?)

While answering questions, type `?` to see:
- **Why we ask**: Explanation of why this information is important
- **Examples**: Real-world examples of good answers

```
[1/7] What is the official name for this project?
  üí° Keep it concise and memorable.
  Type '?' for help on why we ask this question

  Your answer: ?

Why We Ask:
  A clear project name helps stakeholders identify and discuss the project,
  appears in documentation, and is used for file naming and repository organization.

Examples:
  1. Customer Portal v2
  2. Payment Gateway
  3. Analytics Dashboard
  4. Mobile App Backend
```

### Edit Answers in Review Stage

During Stage 2 (Review), you can edit any answer:

```
Your answers so far:

  1. What is the TDD version?
     ‚Üí 1.0

  2. What is the official name for this project?
     ‚Üí E-Commerce Platform

  3. In one or two sentences, what is the core problem this project solves?
     ‚Üí Small businesses lack affordable platforms...

Would you like to edit any answers? (Enter question number, or 'no' to continue): 2

Editing: What is the official name for this project?
Current answer: E-Commerce Platform

  Your answer: Advanced E-Commerce Platform
‚úì Answer updated!
```

### Skip Sections in Deep Dive

During Stage 3 (Deep Dive), you can skip entire sections:

```
‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ Security & Compliance ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ
Security controls and compliance requirements
5 question(s) in this section

Do you want to answer questions in this section? (y/n): n
‚äò Skipping Security & Compliance section
```

## Creating Answer Files

To use `--noninteractive` mode, create a JSON file with your answers:

```json
{
  "doc.version": "1.0",
  "project.name": "My Project",
  "summary.problem": "Users struggle to...",
  "summary.solution": "Build a platform that...",
  "deployment.model": "cloud",
  "cloud.provider": "aws",
  "security.auth": ["oauth2", "mfa"],
  "privacy.pii": true
}
```

**Note:** Field IDs must match the schema. See `schemas/Pre-TDD_Client_Questionnaire_v2.0.json` for all available fields.

## Output

Generated files are saved to the `output/` directory:

```
output/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my_project_tdd.md      # Markdown TDD
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my_project_tdd.pdf     # PDF (if --pdf flag used)
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Quick Start (Interactive)

```bash
node cli.js
```

Follow the prompts through all three stages.

### Example 2: Pre-filled Answers (Non-Interactive)

```bash
node cli.js --noninteractive examples/sample_answers.json --pdf
```

Generate TDD from pre-filled answers and export to PDF.

### Example 3: Security-Focused Deep Dive

```bash
node cli.js --tags security,privacy --complexity enterprise
```

Interactive mode focusing on security and privacy questions at enterprise level.

### Example 4: Quick MVP (Minimal Complexity)

```bash
node cli.js --complexity minimal
```

Interactive mode with fewer questions, suitable for MVPs and prototypes.

## Tips & Best Practices

1. **Start Interactive**: Use interactive mode the first time to understand the questions
2. **Save Time Later**: Export your answers and reuse them with `--noninteractive`
3. **Use Help**: Don't hesitate to type `?` to see examples and explanations
4. **Skip Irrelevant**: Skip entire sections in deep dive that don't apply to your project
5. **Review Carefully**: Take time in Stage 2 to ensure all answers are accurate
6. **Filter Wisely**: Use `--tags` to focus on what matters most for your project
7. **Auto Complexity**: Let the system recommend complexity based on your answers

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Fields Warning

If you see "Missing required information" in non-interactive mode:
- The system will still generate a TDD with "Not Provided" for missing fields
- You can fill in missing information later by editing the output
- Or, run interactive mode to be prompted for missing fields

### Question Not Appearing

Some questions only appear based on previous answers (conditional logic):
- For example, cloud provider questions only appear if deployment model is "cloud"
- PII-related questions only appear if you answer "yes" to handling PII

### Complexity Too High/Low

The auto-recommended complexity is based on your answers:
- Answering "yes" to PII, compliance, multi-region increases complexity
- Use `--complexity` flag to override if needed

## Schema Reference

All questions are defined in:
```
schemas/Pre-TDD_Client_Questionnaire_v2.0.json
```

Tag metadata and complexity levels are in:
```
schemas/Universal_Tag_Schema_v1.1.json
```

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check `README.md` for project overview
2. Review `CONTEXT.md` for architecture details
3. See examples in `tests/` directory
4. Run `node cli.js --help` for quick reference
