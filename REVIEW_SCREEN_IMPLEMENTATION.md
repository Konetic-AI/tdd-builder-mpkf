# Review Screen Component - Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Review Screen Component is an enhanced user interface for the TDD Builder CLI that allows users to review their answers, see a preview of the TDD sections that will be generated, and make edits before final TDD generation.

## Features

### ✅ 1. Grouped Answers Display
Answers are now displayed grouped by their corresponding TDD sections (Stage 1-9) instead of a flat list:

```
Stage 1: Project Foundation
  [101] What is the TDD version?
        → 2.0.0
  [102] What is the creation date?
        → 2025-01-15

Stage 2: Requirements & Context Analysis
  [201] What are the primary business goals?
        → Reduce TDD creation time by 75%
```

**Benefits:**
- Better organization and context
- Easy to see which sections have answers
- Clear relationship between questions and TDD output

### ✅ 2. TDD Section Preview (Headings Only)
Shows which TDD sections will be generated based on current answers and complexity level:

```
TDD PREVIEW - Sections to be Generated (Complexity: standard)

  ✓ Stage 1: Project Foundation
    [██████████████████████████████] 100% complete
    4/4 required fields answered

  ◐ Stage 4: Non-Functional Requirements
    [███████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 50% complete
    1/2 required fields answered

  ○ Stage 6: Operations & Observability
    [░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 0% complete
    0/1 required fields answered
```

**Benefits:**
- Visual feedback on completeness
- Clear indication of what will be included in TDD
- Helps users understand gaps before generation
- Conditional sections accurately reflected

### ✅ 3. Inline Edit Functionality
Users can edit any answer by entering its number in brackets:

```
Enter answer number to edit, or 'done' to finish: 102

Editing: What is the creation date?
Current answer: 2025-01-15

  Your answer: 2025-10-07

✓ Answer updated!
```

**Benefits:**
- Fix mistakes without restarting
- No need to go through entire flow again
- Edit multiple answers in one session

### ✅ 4. Confirmation Before Generation
After review (and optional deep dive), users see a final review with confirmation:

```
READY TO GENERATE TDD

Proceed with TDD generation? (yes/no/edit):
```

**Options:**
- `yes` - Proceed with generation
- `no` - Cancel generation
- `edit` - Make final edits before generation

**Benefits:**
- Last chance to review before generation
- Prevents accidental generation with incomplete data
- Clear control over the process

## Architecture

### Files Created/Modified

#### New Files:
- `src/lib/reviewScreen.js` - Main review screen component
- `src/lib/reviewScreen.test.js` - Unit tests (14 tests, all passing)

#### Modified Files:
- `cli.js` - Integrated review screen into Stage 2 and added final review after Stage 3

### Key Functions

#### `groupAnswersBySection(answers, schema)`
Groups answers by their corresponding TDD sections.

**Parameters:**
- `answers` - Object with field IDs and answers
- `schema` - Questionnaire schema with questions

**Returns:** Array of sections with grouped answers

#### `generateTddPreview(answers, complexity)`
Generates preview of TDD sections based on answers and complexity level.

**Parameters:**
- `answers` - Current answers
- `complexity` - Complexity level (base, minimal, standard, comprehensive, enterprise)

**Returns:** Array of stages with completeness information

#### `displayReviewScreen(answers, schema, tagSchema, complexity, colors)`
Displays the full review screen with grouped answers and TDD preview.

**Parameters:**
- `answers` - Current answers
- `schema` - Questionnaire schema
- `tagSchema` - Tag schema
- `complexity` - Complexity level
- `colors` - CLI color codes

#### `handleAnswerEditing(answers, schema, promptFn, askQuestionFn, colors)`
Handles inline answer editing workflow.

**Parameters:**
- `answers` - Current answers
- `schema` - Questionnaire schema
- `promptFn` - Readline prompt function
- `askQuestionFn` - Function to ask questions
- `colors` - CLI color codes

**Returns:** Promise<object> - Updated answers

#### `confirmGeneration(promptFn, colors)`
Prompts user for confirmation before TDD generation.

**Returns:** Promise<object> - Action object with 'generate', 'edit', or 'cancel'

## User Flow

### Standard Interview Flow

1. **Stage 1: Core Questions** (5-7 questions)
   - User answers essential questions

2. **Stage 2: Review** (NEW!)

   - Recommended complexity level
   - Option to edit answers inline

3. **Stage 3: Deep Dive** (optional)
   - Detailed questions by topic
   - Can skip entire sections

4. **Final Review** (NEW!)

   - Confirmation prompt
   - Option for final edits

5. **TDD Generation**
   - Generate TDD with all collected data

## Acceptance Criteria

✅ **Users can fix mistakes without restarting**
- Inline edit functionality allows editing any answer
- No need to restart the entire interview

✅ **Preview reflects conditional sections accurately**
- TDD preview shows exactly which sections will be included
- Completeness percentage reflects current answers
- Different complexity levels show different sections

✅ **Answers grouped by section**
- Clear visual organization by TDD stages
- Easy to understand which section each answer belongs to

## Testing

### Unit Tests
All 14 unit tests passing:
- Section mapping (5 tests)
- Answer grouping (2 tests)
- TDD preview generation (6 tests)
- Color utilities (1 test)

### Integration Test
Manual testing completed with sample data showing:
- Correct grouping by sections
- Accurate preview for all complexity levels
- Visual progress bars and status indicators
- Proper color coding

## Visual Indicators

### Status Icons
- `✓` (Green) - Complete (100%)
- `◐` (Yellow) - Partial (50-99%)
- `○` (Red) - Minimal (0-49%)

### Progress Bars
- `█` - Filled portion
- `░` - Empty portion
- Shows visual completion percentage

### Colors
- **Cyan** - Section headers and question numbers
- **Green** - Answers and completion status
- **Yellow** - Partial completion and warnings
- **Red** - Missing or incomplete items
- **Magenta** - TDD section titles
- **Dim** - Secondary information

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Search/Filter**: Filter answers by keyword or section
2. **Bulk Edit**: Edit multiple related answers at once
3. **Export Review**: Save review to file for later reference
4. **Side-by-side Comparison**: Compare current answers with template defaults
5. **Validation Summary**: Show all validation warnings in one view
6. **Answer History**: Show previous values when editing
7. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Quick navigation between sections
8. **Progress Persistence**: Save progress and resume later

## Performance

- Grouping: O(n) where n is number of answers
- Preview generation: O(m) where m is number of stages
- Display: Single pass through data structures
- No blocking operations
- Immediate user feedback

## Accessibility

- Clear visual hierarchy
- Status indicators with both color and symbols
- Descriptive labels and prompts
- Keyboard-only navigation
- Screen reader friendly text output

## Conclusion

The Review Screen Component successfully implements all requested features:
- ✅ Grouped answers display
- ✅ TDD section preview with headings
- ✅ Inline edit functionality
- ✅ Confirmation before generation
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met

The implementation is fully tested, documented, and integrated into the existing CLI workflow.
